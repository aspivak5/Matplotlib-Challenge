Pymaceuticals Observations :
1) The correlation coefficent for mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen is 0.84, indicating a strong postive correlation. As the mice weight increased the average tumor volume increased as well for the mice on the Capomulin regimen.
2) The study was well conducted as it used an even representation of male and female mice and tested the same amount of mice (25 mice) for each drug with the exception for Stelasyn (24 mice).
3) The Capomulin and Ramicane regimen had the lowest average tumor volumes as well as the lowest final tumor volumes, suggesting that these drug regimens work best in reducing tumor size.
